Getting PSICAT building on the hot LacCore MPB was challenging, due in large part
to ancient griffon and gradle. Ran into SSL issues trying to use Gradle 1.3, so
dependencies couldn't be downloaded. Attempting to copy over .griffon and .gradle
dirs from older laptops where PSICAT builds also proved fruitless.

Ultimately got it working by incrementally building coretools, coretools-data, etc
in Gradle 6.  I was unable to retrieve remote dependencies in Gradle 6, so ultimately
copied over all the required .jar files from an existing working project into coretools/deps.
Then futzed around and found that adding

flatDir {
    dirs '../deps'
}

to the build.gradle repositories {} element was enough to build the coretools lib.

Each project's build.gradle needed to be updated - for the coretools etc. subprojects
this involved changing

manifest.mainAttributes {
    // [attributes]
}

to Gradle 6 compliant

jar {
    manifest {
        attributes(
            // [attributes]
        )
    }
}

. With those changes in place, I was able to incrementally build coretools, coretools-data,
and so on by progressively uncommenting those projects in settings.gradle.  Once those built,
I moved onto building PSICAT and SchemeEditor.

The PSICAT and SchemeEditor build.gradle files were more complex...updated their manifest element
as above.  Had to remove all "<<" in task definitions.  Then commented all other tasks out...they
remain in commented state, need to dig into re-enabling them for packaging purposes once we have
need of another build.

After these changes, I was still unable to call e.g. "gradle init" from the PSICAT and SchemeEditor
dirs as I was in the past.  However, calling "gradle tools:PSICAT:init" from the root coretools dirs
worked correctly.

Launching PSICAT still failed due to lack of the installer plugin (so fucking annoying that it requires
the plugin even for tasks that don't use it).  I copied griffon-installer-0.4.zip from a working laptop's
.griffon/0.2/plugins dir into that dir on the LacCore MPB.  This too was insufficient!  Griffon 0.2 also
wants the fucking .xml plugin list!  Once that was copied into .griffon/0.2 (not .griffon/0.2/plugins),
calling "griffon run-app" in tools/PSICAT finally launched the app correctly, yay!
